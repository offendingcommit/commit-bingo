# NiceGUI Storage Architecture Findings

## Key Discoveries from Documentation

### 1. Application Lifecycle
- NiceGUI apps start with `ui.run()` which launches the web server
- The app uses FastAPI/Starlette underneath with Uvicorn as the ASGI server
- Frontend uses Vue.js, Quasar, and Tailwind CSS

### 2. Storage Implementation Details
From the documentation analysis:
- No explicit mention of `app.storage.general` being client-side localStorage
- Storage appears to be a NiceGUI abstraction but implementation details not clear
- The framework focuses on reactive UI elements, not persistent storage

### 3. Server Architecture
- Built on top of FastAPI (ASGI framework)
- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Docker deployment is well-supported
- Can run behind reverse proxies (nginx examples provided)

### 4. Missing Information
The documentation doesn't clearly explain:
- Whether `app.storage` is server-side or client-side
- How storage persists across server restarts
- Best practices for state persistence
- Lifecycle hooks for initialization

## Implications for Our Issue

1. **Storage Type Unclear**: The docs don't confirm if `app.storage.general` is browser localStorage or server-side storage

2. **No State Persistence Examples**: No examples show persisting game state across server restarts

3. **Docker/Production Focus**: Examples focus on deployment but not on state management

4. **Testing Approach**: The testing framework uses a `Screen` class for UI testing, not state persistence testing

## Recommended Architecture Based on Findings

Since NiceGUI documentation doesn't provide clear guidance on persistent storage:

1. **Assume Client-Side**: Treat `app.storage.general` as client-side until proven otherwise
2. **Implement Server-Side**: Create our own server-side persistence layer
3. **Use FastAPI Features**: Leverage the underlying FastAPI for lifecycle management
4. **File/DB Storage**: Implement file or database storage independent of NiceGUI

## Next Steps

1. Test if `app.storage.general` survives server restarts (empirical testing)
2. Implement server-side storage solution (file or SQLite)
3. Use FastAPI lifecycle events for initialization
4. Create proper state management layer
