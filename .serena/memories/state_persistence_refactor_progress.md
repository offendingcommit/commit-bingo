# State Persistence Refactor Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- Identified that `app.storage.general` is client-side (browser localStorage)
- Documented 6 core issues with current architecture
- Created memory with detailed analysis

### 2. Failing Tests Created
- `tests/test_state_persistence_bugs.py` - Reproduces hot reload issues
- `tests/test_state_persistence_bdd.py` - BDD scenarios with pytest-bdd
- `tests/test_state_persistence_issues.py` - Comprehensive architecture problems
- `tests/features/state_persistence.feature` - Gherkin scenarios

### 3. New Architecture Designed
- Created `src/core/state_manager.py` with server-side file persistence
- Implements atomic writes, debouncing, and concurrency control
- Uses asyncio locks for thread safety
- Created comprehensive tests in `tests/test_state_manager.py`

### 4. GitHub Issue Updated
- Added investigation findings to issue #13
- Documented root causes and proposed solutions
- Listed all failing tests created

## Next Steps

### 1. Refactor game_logic.py
Replace current save/load functions with state manager:
```python
from src.core.state_manager import get_state_manager

# Replace save_state_to_storage()
async def save_state():
    manager = get_state_manager()
    await manager.save_state()

# Replace toggle_tile()  
async def toggle_tile(row, col):
    manager = get_state_manager()
    clicked = await manager.toggle_tile(row, col)
    # Update UI based on clicked state
```

### 2. Update app.py initialization
```python
from src.core.state_manager import get_state_manager

def init_app():
    # Initialize state manager (loads from file)
    manager = get_state_manager()
    
    # Use manager state instead of load_state_from_storage()
    if manager.board:
        # State loaded from file
        pass
    else:
        # Generate fresh board
        pass
```

### 3. Update UI routes
- Modify routes.py to use state manager
- Update sync.py to read from state manager
- Remove dependency on app.storage.general

### 4. Migration Strategy
- Phase 1: Add state manager alongside existing code
- Phase 2: Update all read operations to use state manager
- Phase 3: Update all write operations to use state manager
- Phase 4: Remove old save/load functions
- Phase 5: Clean up and optimize

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Fix Python environment issues (pydantic architecture mismatch)
- Run new state manager tests
- Update existing tests to use state manager
- Add integration tests for restart scenarios
- Verify all BDD scenarios pass

## Key Decisions Made

1. **File-based persistence** chosen for simplicity
2. **Async/await pattern** for all state operations
3. **Debounced saves** to reduce I/O overhead
4. **Atomic writes** using temp file + rename
5. **Global singleton** pattern for state manager

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: File I/O blocking UI
   **Mitigation**: Async operations with debouncing

2. **Risk**: Concurrent updates causing data loss
   **Mitigation**: asyncio locks on all operations

3. **Risk**: File corruption on crash
   **Mitigation**: Atomic writes with temp files

4. **Risk**: Migration breaking existing games
   **Mitigation**: Phased rollout with backwards compatibility
